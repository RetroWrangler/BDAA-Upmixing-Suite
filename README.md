- **TrueHD** - For TrueHD 7.1 Spatial output

### üñ±Ô∏è Intuitive User Interface
- **Drag & Drop** - Drop audio files directly into the main area
- **Smart Format Restrictions** - File formats automatically filter based on output type
- **Folder Drop Support** - Drag folders directly into the output directory field
- **Professional Dark Blue Theme** - Easy on the eyes for long sessions
- **Real-time Progress Tracking** - Monitor conversion status for each file

## System Requirements

- macOS 11.5 or later
- FFmpeg (bundled with application - no manual installation required)
- Sufficient disk space for output files

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `BDAA Upmixing Suite.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project
4. FFmpeg is bundled automatically - no manual installation needed

### macOS Security Notice

If you encounter a "cannot scan for malware" warning when running the built app:

**Option 1: Developer Signing (Recommended)**
- Join the Apple Developer Program
- Code sign the application with your Developer ID certificate
- Optionally notarize for complete trust

**Option 2: User Override**
- Right-click the app ‚Üí "Open" ‚Üí "Open" to bypass the warning
- Or go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí "Open Anyway"

This warning appears because the app is not code-signed by an Apple Developer ID certificate.

## Usage

1. **Select Output Format** - Choose your desired surround sound format
2. **Choose Quality** - Select bit depth and sample rate (for PCM formats)
3. **Pick File Format** - Choose output container format
4. **Add Audio Files** - Drag audio files into the drop area or click "Select Files"
5. **Set Output Directory** - Drag a folder into the output field or click the folder icon
6. **Convert** - Click the convert button to start processing

## Smart Format Logic

The application intelligently restricts file format options based on your output format selection:

- **PCM Formats** (2.0, 5.1, 7.1) + **Atmos Ready 7.1.4**: FLAC, ALAC, WAV, AIFF available
- **TrueHD Formats** (7.1 Spatial Enhanced, 7.1.4 Enhanced): Only TrueHD (.thd) available
- **DTS Enhanced Formats** (7.1 Enhanced, 7.1.4 :X Ready): Only DTS (.dts) available
- **THX Formats** (7.1 Certified, 7.1.4 Spatial Audio): FLAC, ALAC, WAV, AIFF available

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Audio Processing
- Uses bundled FFmpeg 7.1 for high-quality audio processing
- Advanced spatial processing with stereo field enhancement
- Psychoacoustic depth enhancement using Haas effect
- Dynamic range optimization and clarity enhancement
- Supports security-scoped bookmarks for sandboxed file access

### Spatial Processing Algorithms
- **Enhanced Stereo Field**: Widens stereo image before upmixing using `extrastereo`
- **Haas Effect**: Adds psychoacoustic depth perception with subtle delays
- **Dynamic Normalization**: Optimizes dynamic range while preserving transients
- **Clarity Enhancement**: Uses `crystalizer` for enhanced detail and presence
- **Synthetic Height Channels**: Creates 7.1.4 compatible output with height simulation
- **Spatial TrueHD/DTS**: Enhanced encoding with advanced spatial imaging
- **THX Certification**: Optimized processing for THX-certified playback systems
